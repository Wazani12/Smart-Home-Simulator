Smart Home Simulator
=======

**Smart Home Simulator** is a Java console application that simulates a smart home environment. It demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including:

- **Abstraction:** Abstract Device class as the parent for all devices.  
- **Inheritance:** Child classes such as Light, AC, Door, and Camera extend Device.  
- **Encapsulation:** All device properties are private with getters and setters.  
- **Polymorphism:** Abstract methods overridden by child classes.  
- **Static members:** Tracks the total number of devices created.  
- **Interfaces:** Controllable interface for manual and automatic control.  
- **Inner classes:** Scheduler class inside SmartHome for scheduled actions.  
- **Enums:** Room and DeviceStatus for type safety.

## Features
- Turn devices ON/OFF manually.
- Schedule devices using the Scheduler inner class.
- Display a neat and formatted status report for all devices.

## Usage
1. Run the `Main` class.
2. Observe the simulation of devices turning ON/OFF and status reporting.
3. Use the Scheduler to change device statuses programmatically.

This project is a great example for beginners to learn Java OOP concepts and organize a full mini-project with multiple classes and features.
